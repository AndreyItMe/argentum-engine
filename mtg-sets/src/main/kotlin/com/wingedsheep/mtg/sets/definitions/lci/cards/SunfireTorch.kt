/**
 * Sunfire Torch (LCI #167) — {R} Artifact — Equipment (common)
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+0 and has "Whenever this creature attacks, you may sacrifice
 * Sunfire Torch. When you do, this creature deals 2 damage to any target."
 * Equip {1}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The +1/+0 buff is a [ModifyStats] static scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature].
 * - The quoted attack ability is granted to the equipped creature via [GrantTriggeredAbility]
 *   + [Triggers.attacks] (SELF binding, the Pirate Hat / Dire Blunderbuss idiom), so it lives
 *   on the creature and fires when that creature attacks. The body is a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect]:
 *   the optional action sacrifices Sunfire Torch; only "when you do" puts the reflexive part on
 *   the stack to choose any target and deal 2 damage. The damage source defaults to the granted
 *   ability's source — the equipped creature — matching "this creature deals 2 damage."
 *
 * KNOWN APPROXIMATION — "sacrifice Sunfire Torch":
 * As with Dire Blunderbuss, granted *triggered* abilities resolve with the equipped creature
 * as their source and no reference to the granting Equipment, so the self-sacrifice is modeled
 * as a name filter (`Artifact you control named "Sunfire Torch"`). Corner case: with a second
 * Sunfire Torch on the battlefield the printed ability sacrifices *this* one, but the name
 * filter lets you pick either. Accepted, documented corner.
